Installation
------------
make make install
or
dpkg-buildpackage dpkg -i

Usage
-----
1. Install the plugin.
2. Configure the joystick device in setup menu.
3. Enable testmode in the setup menu. This will print the generic
   event ID of pressed keys on OSD.
4. Edit keymap.txt in the plugin configuration directory to your
   needs.
5. Restart VDR


SVDRP
-----

The plugin can be enabled and disabled via SVDRP commands
(ENABLE/DISABLE). This may be useful to close the joystick device and
allow another frontend (e.g. XBMC) to use it.


keymap.txt
----------

The keymap.txt file in the plugins configuration directory allows
to specify the following settings for each key:
- VDR_KEY Supported keys are
    Down Up Menu Ok Back Left Right Red Green Yellow Blue Info
    PlayPause Play Pause Stop Record FastFwd FastRew Next Prev Power
    ChanUp ChanDn ChanPrev VolUp VolDn Mute Audio Subtitles Schedule
    Channels Timers Recordings Setup Commands User0 User1 User2 User3
    User4 User5 User6 User7 User8 User9
- REPEAT The repeat intervall in ms. To disable autorepeat set this
  to 0.
- HOLD The time in ms between the key press and the start of the
  auto repeat mechanism.


How it works
------------
The plugin uses the kernel joystick API [1] to get events from
joystick devices.
It constists of two threads. The first one opens a kernel joystick
device and maps buttons and axis movements to generic events. The
event ID is calculated as follows:
    - If the event is a button, the generic event ID equalls the
      button number.
    - If the event is a axis movement, the generic event ID is
      calculated as OFFSET+2*AXIS_NUMBER+DIR. Where OFFSEt is the
      maximum number of supported buttons (16) and DIR is ether 0
      or 1 and depends on the axis movement direction.
When a button/axis is pressed or released the generic event ID is
reported to the second thread. This one maps the generic events to
VDR keys (as specified in keymap.txt) and handles autorepeated
key presses.
